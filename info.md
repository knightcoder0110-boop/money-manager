I am planning to create a finance manager app for myselft. not for anyone else but for myself.

its getting so difficult to manage finannces and i weaste so much money, and at the end i dont know where that money goes.

Its super important.

I want to create a simple app that can help me track my expenses and income, but at the same time has all the breakdowns.

i can enter how much negative i am right now, or posotive, if i wanna improve, things i need to stop wasting on.

better would be like i want to have two modes, one is budget and another is normal mode, on budget mode only important things are allowed, no wastage, its like war .

we will build this step wise, not everything at once. so yeah, so that we know what we are building, and can use it and build it along the way.

I will tell you major types of things i do, so that we can track these.

rent, food, transport, shopping, bills, entertainment, subscription like gemini/claude, etc, hostings,etc, like these can come under professional savings, investments, girlfriend, given to family, given to friends.

also lets say i go on date for 2 days with my girl, or lets say i go on a trip, i should be able to lets say breakdown on lets say i went out with girl for 2 days, so berakdown like food, transport, gift, etc

you know what i mean, even in main categories/subcategroies, idk how to tell this should be able to add these so that i can track them, no penny goes unspent.

also daily things, like lets say i go out for tea, or small snacks, there should be a thing to track these, small daily nuaniances


also one very very imp thing

for just learning purpuse, for every penny spent one thing is must, tag it with required/necennessary , unnecessary. this is for learning myself, if i stay only wiht strict thing, what can i achieve.

you get the whole idea right.

so try to understand this very very very well.

polish my idea really really well

we will build it so that we can easily use it, also shoudl be able to host it and use int in my mobile as well. so must be respoisnive.

also bro must be amazing. for now just polish my idea, make it conceret it, make it awesome. and then write down the plan in a folder. don't start actual coding now, just think and plan for now
